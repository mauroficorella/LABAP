% Initial idea --------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\section{Initial idea}
Interactive dashboard to look for images uploaded by other users.

\subsection{System objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Show the dashboard with most popular images and images uploaded by followed users
    \item Manage user authentication
    \item Show a page related to usersâ€™ profiles containing all the images uploaded by them
    \item Allow users to upload, search and see images
    \item Allow users to follow other users to easily access their user profile and images
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distributed Software Application with Containerization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Front-end layer}:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Login/registration page
     \item Homepage
     \item User profile page
     \item User settings page
     \item Image visualization page with description and comments
     \item Image upload page
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{API gateway}: to take an application user's request, route it to one or more backend services, gather the appropriate data and deliver it to the user in a single, combined package    
    \item \textbf{Logic layer}: 
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Microservice for user management: handles registration/authentication/access to the user profile
     \item Microservice for notifications: allows the user to be notified about new likes or new comments on his images and new followers
     \item Microservice for images management: handles the upload and deletion of images
     \item Microservice for social part: allows the user to like/comment/save an image and follow another user
     \item Microservice for search: handles the search of an image or an user
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Persistence layer}: NoSQL database
\end{itemize}
Each element of this list represents a different Docker container of the system and all the containers are orchestrated using Docker Compose.

\subsection{Potential Users}
\begin{itemize}
    \item People interested in discovering images from people that they follow
    \item People interested in uploading and sharing images

% System architecture ---------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\section{System architecture}
The system architecture is based on microservices, each running on its own Docker container and each accessing its own data. These containers are orchestrated through Docker Compose.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/architecture.png}
    \caption{Overview of system architecture}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend:} developed in React (based on TypeScript, HTML and CSS). Users interact with the system through this layer.
    \item \textbf{API Gateway:} we use Kong Gateway which is a lightweight, fast, and flexible cloud-native API gateway that serves as a reverse proxy that lets us manage, configure, and route requests to our APIs exposed by the microservices.
    \item \textbf{Microservice for social part:} exposes APIs to manage all social aspects of the system (i.e. user registration, likes, comments, new posts).
    \item \textbf{Microservice for images management:} exposes APIs to upload images on the Firebase cloud storage.
    \item \textbf{Microservice for search:} we use Elasticsearch as search engine and Kibana, which provides search and data visualization capabilities for data indexed in Elasticsearch. Moreover we use Deepdetect deep learning platform which offers pre-trained models for classifing images' based on represented subjects and to be able to search for images based on them through Elasticsearch.
    \item \textbf{Microservice for notifications:} we use RabbitMQ message oriented middleware through CloudAMQP, which provides managed RabbitMQ servers in the cloud, in order to be able to access all the different queues in the cloud from any device.
    \item \textbf{Database:} we use Neo4j NoSQL graph database in order to store all the system data. In particular we use Neo4j AuraDB that offers a database instance in the cloud with which all the above mentioned microservices can communicate. 
\end{itemize}
We developed the backend microservices using Python and all of them expose a REST interface that leverages on FastAPI framework.
